# **Security Policy**

SenzMatica takes the security of our users and the ecosystem seriously. We follow industry-standard practices for responsible disclosure and encourage the community to report vulnerabilities safely and privately.

If you discover a security issue, please do not open a public GitHub issue. Instead, follow the process below.

# **Reporting a Vulnerability**

To report a security vulnerability, please email: [info@senzmate.com](mailto:info@senzmate.com)

Your report should include:

* A description of the issue  
* Steps to reproduce (if possible)  
* Potential impact  
* Any suggested remediation  
* Your contact information for follow-up questions

You will receive an acknowledgment within 3 business days.

# **Security Response Process**

Once a report is received:

1. The security team reviews the issue and determines the severity.  
2. A fix is developed privately in a restricted branch or fork.  
3. Once validated, the patch is merged and released.  
4. Security advisories (GHSA) are published as needed.  
5. The reporter is credited unless they request anonymity.

We strive to resolve critical issues as quickly as possible and follow coordinated disclosure best practices.

# **Supported Versions**

Security fixes will be backported to:

* The latest stable release  
* The previous stable minor release (if feasible)

Pre-1.0 releases (0.x) may receive fixes at the discretion of the maintainers.

# **Public Communication**

Security announcements will be published through:

* GitHub Security Advisories  
* Release notes  
* The OpenChoreo community channels
